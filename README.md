# Building Insurance Claim Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to predict
insurance claims based on building characteristics. The goal is to understand
how factors such as building age, construction material, location, and occupancy
influence the likelihood of an insurance claim.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Name: Building_Insurance.csv
- Number of Buildings: 20
- The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features.
- The target variable is **Claim** (Yes/No).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- GitHub
- Napkin AI (for visual insights)

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## 📈 Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature encoding and scaling
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Model comparison and conclusion

## 📊 Visualization
Some exploratory visualizations and insights were generated using **Napkin AI**.
These visuals helped in understanding patterns in the dataset before modeling.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload `Building_Insurance.csv`
3. Click **Runtime → Run all**

## ✅ Conclusion
The project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline and compares two
machine learning models for insurance claim prediction.
